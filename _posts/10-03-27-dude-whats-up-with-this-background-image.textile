I've always quite liked the scaling background image on "the Fronteers website":http://fronteers.nl, so I stole their idea to give my website some pizazz. 

Since I didn't have a great background -- nor am I graphically sane enough to think of something -- I decided to do something fun and fetch my latest "Mobypicture":http://mobypicture.com photo. That's why there's always a completely irrelevant image as my website's background, like "@roy ordering plane tickets":http://www.mobypicture.com/user/jkreeftmeijer/view/6221055 or "@antekpiechink getting us stroopwafel McFlurry's":http://www.mobypicture.com/user/jkreeftmeijer/view/6204421.

Mobypicture doesn't provide a direct link to your last image ("@mathys liked the idea though":http://twitter.com/mathys/status/11036784161), so a simple call to their "API":http://api.mobypicture.com/doc and some @cURL@ did the trick. The source can be found in "this site's repo on Github":http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/jeffkreeftmeijer.com.
