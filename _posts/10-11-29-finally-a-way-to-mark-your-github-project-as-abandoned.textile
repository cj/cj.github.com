  *tl;dr* Check out "stillmaintained.com(Still Maintained?)":http://stillmaintained.com to create some nice maintenance status pages for your Github projects.
</span>

Back when it was still nice and sunny outside, I wrote an article about "abandoned open source projects":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/abandoned-open-source-projects, in which I proposed a way to mark Github projects as abandoned. There was "some discussion":http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1528523 and a "feature request":http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/987-abandoned-projects, but nobody seemed to have nice and clean enough solution that solved the problem.

I almost forgot about the whole thing, until I started getting a bunch of questions and pull requests for old projects again.

"!http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/images/stillmaintained.jpg!":http://stillmaintained.com

I decided to spend a Monday to build a simple application called "stillmaintained.com(Still Maintained?)":http://stillmaintained.com that keeps a list of open source projects and makes it easy to give your own projects a state (maintained, looking for a new maintainer or abandoned). This way, each project gets a nice status page. Here's "Fuubar's":http://stillmaintained.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/fuubar.

h3. Help!

The current version isn't much yet, but you can at least start adding your projects. There's a lot of stuff to be done and a lot of ideas to consider (like doing something about that long "projects page":http://stillmaintained.com/projects or adding an API), but hey, it's a start.

If you want to help out, the project is "on Github":https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/stillmaintained, so be sure to create an "issue":https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/stillmaintained/issues if you have a great idea or run into something weird.

Also, it would be awesome if you took a moment and added your projects to the list. It'll only take you about a minute.

What do you think? Is this a way to help solve the abandoned project issue? Have any awesome ideas already? Be sure to let me know.
