title: Stumbling into Vim
excerpt: After using Textmate for everything In the last few years, I checked out Vim last week. Here's what happened.

I’ve been using "Textmate":http://macromates.com/ since I switched to the Mac a while back. It worked properly and I was fine with it. I never looked into "Vim":http://www.vim.org until a few months after "@antekpiechinik":http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik told me I should. That was last week.

To be honest, I thought Vim was for people that felt too cool to go out of their terminals and that it didn’t really add anything other than “I’m in the terminal”-awesomeness. Needless to say, I was wrong.

After I got excited by "this &ldquo;Welcome to Vim&rdquo;-video":http://vimeo.com/6999927, I dove into the @vimtutor@ to learn about normal, edit and visual mode, jumping though files, deleting, adding copying and editing stuff, running terminal commands from my text editor and stuff like that. @vimtutor@ is awesome, it walks you through the very basics to get familiar with the commands you'll be using most. 

After finishing that, I realized Vim was blazingly fast if you know the right shortcuts to use. Also, I felt quite confident about the Vim skills I learned, which lasted for about ten minutes until I tried to edit an actual Ruby file, got stuck and came to the conclusion that I forgot half of what I've learned.

Although I'm still struggling, I believe using Vim will be a lot faster in comparison to Textmate after a while. I'll probably have to go through the @vimtutor@ again some time, though.

h3. Customizing Vim

I’ve never really taken the time to customize Textmate, except for installing the "Railscasts theme":http://railscasts.com/about and the "Ruby":http://github.com/drnic/ruby-tmbundle and "Rails":http://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle bundles. That was all I needed. No RSpec or Git bundles, I prefer to run specs and push to my repository in the terminal. Heck, I never even used Textmate’s snippets and forgot to use CMD+T to open files all the time.

After using Vim for a while, I realized I was missing some things. So I installed the "Railscasts Vim color scheme":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175 and "NERDTree":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658 as substitutes for Textmate's theme and project drawer. 

NERDTree is an awesome plugin, but since I got tired of typing @:NERDTreeToggle@ to open and close it I mapped it to my F2 key. Super fast.

Vim has no line numbers by default, which creeped me out. Putting @set number@ in my @./~vimrc@ file did the trick. I searched around and stole some settings from other people too. Man, this thing is customizable.

Oh, I’ve put everything in my "dotfiles repository on Github":http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/dotfiles. In case you need it.

As I said, I still have a lot to learn but I think I'll stick to Vim for at least a while. So, keep an eye on this space for more vim stuff in the future and if you have some tips: be sure to let me know!
