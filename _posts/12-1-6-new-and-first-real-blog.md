So I've been wanting to start a blog for a long time and I finally have one I'm happy with, thanks to
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jeff Kreeftmeijer](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/).  You'll notice
his blog is very similar :)

You just can't beat the simplicity, which is what I like about it the most.  The way
it also handles code snippets, images etc... which I'll be posting a lot of is just
beautiful.  Take a look for yourselves.

{% highlight javascript %}
(function( $ ) {
  $.fn.myPlugin = function() {
    // Do your awesome plugin stuff here
  };
})( jQuery );
{% endhighlight %}

What about an image you say? ..... how about a happy cow!

That's it for now, I can't think of better time to start a blog than at the start of
a new year!  Expect a lot of articles to come in the future, from code snippets to interesting things
I come across on a daily basis.  Plus a lot rants and raves!
