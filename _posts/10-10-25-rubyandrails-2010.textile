If you follow any of us on Twitter, you probably know "80beans":http://80beans.com went to "RubyAndRails":http://rubyandrails.eu in Amsterdam last week. In this weeks article, I'll try to explain what inspired me the most. If you need a _proper_ talk overview, check out "the RubyAndRails blog":http://rubyandrails.eu/blog.

h3. Rails 3 Mountable apps

"@drogus(Piotr Sarnacki)":http://twitter.com/drogus gave a talk about the work he did on mountable applications in Rails 3 during the "Ruby Summer of Code":http://rubysoc.org/. While the ultimate goal was to have multiple Rails applications running in a single process, development switched to boosting the (existing) Rails Engines to be &ldquo;almost as powerful as applications&rdquo;. In fact, the only difference is that engines have to be mounted and can't be run standalone.

I had a brief but very inspiring chat with Piotr during the Geek dinner and I'm sure we'll hear a lot from him in the future.

h3. Live music-hacking-jam-session

"@rosejn(Jeff Rose)":http://twitter.com/rosejn and "@samaaron(Sam Aaron)":http://twitter.com/samaaron (the "@lambdatones(Î»-tones)":http://twitter.com/lambdatones) gave a presentation on building audio synthesizers with "Overtone":http://project-overtone.org/ and playing music in Clojure. They even did an amazing "live music-hacking-jam-session":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXovdAEV_mI&hd=1.

h3. Profiling and Frankenstein programming

"@chastell(Piotr Szotkowski)":http://twitter.com/chastell dove into "Project Euler's problem #10":http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=10 and found out finding the sum of all the primes below two million got extremely slow in Ruby. In his talk, he went over a couple of profiling tools and eventually went with "perftools.rb":http://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb/ for having the least overhead. After that, he went on tweaking the calculation code and eventually using "RubyInline":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/ to be able to use inline C, creating a really fast Frankenstein of languages.

h3. Fighter jet pilots

"@coreyhaines(Corey Haines)":http://twitter.com/coreyhaines did an amazingly inspiring talk about a lot of things we (should) already know -- like BDD and pair programming -- but also reminded us of how awesome our profession is, without even coming close to the awesomeness of being a fighter jet pilot. He urged everyone in the room to practice more to become happier programmers.

bq. &ldquo; How did you get so happy?, Because I practiced and now I'm awesome at programming. &rdquo;

I'm still not sure why I missed the "Code Retreat":http://coderetreat.com/ on Saturday.

h3. Fancy programming

"@bakkdoor(Christopher "Mr. Fancy" Bertels)":http://twitter.com/bakkdoor gave a talk about his programming language called "Fancy":http://www.fancy-lang.org/. Inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby and Erlang and running on Rubinius since a couple of weeks, Fancy aims to be a reasonably fast truly object oriented dynamic language that's easy to understand.

Fancy was written for fun and it seems like an amazing way to learn about programming in general:

bq. &ldquo; We're very open to discussion on anything related to the language, its features or semantics. It's about the fun after all. &rdquo;

h3. Mining for RubyGems

"Fingertips":http://fngtps.com won this years "Rumble":http://rubyandrails.eu/rumble with "Miner":http://github.com/Fingertips/miner: a simple MacRuby application that displays interesting new projects in an App Store for Rubygems, complete with one-click installation. This application and its "online counterpart":http://minerapp.com were built in under eight hours. How's that for inspiring?

h3. See you all next year!

There were a lot more interesting talks, but these were some that inspired me to get my hands dirty again. I had a lot of fun and I talked to a lot of interesting people during the pre-party, the Github meetup and the Geek dinner. Thanks everyone, I hope to see you all again next year!
