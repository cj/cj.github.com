I participated in the "May 15 & 16 Rails 3 Bugmash":http://railsbridge.org/news_items/12 last weekend. This was my first Bugmash (if you don't count getting "Navvy":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/navvy up to speed with Rails 3 in "the last one":http://railsbridge.org/news_items/11). I had lots of fun, resolved two tickets that applied to the Rails @master@ and the @2-3-stable@ branch, reviewed some patches by others, got five commits into Rails, "finished in second place":http://bugmash.com/,  and got on "the contributor list":http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/jeff-kreeftmeijer/commits.

All Saturday (I couldn't make it on Sunday), experienced Rails contributors and core team members were available for questions in the #railsbridge IRC channel. Everybody was very helpful and friendly, which  made it a lot easier to dive in and debug in the Rails source. 

Something that also made everything a little easier was "rails_test_box":http://github.com/jeroenvandijk/rails_test_box. It uses "VirtualBox":http://virtualbox.org and "Vagrant":http://vagrantup.com/ to set up an isolated testing environment so you can run Rails' tests without worrying about messing up your development environment.

It installs "MySQL":http://www.mysql.com/ and "PostgreSQL":http://www.postgresql.org/ for you, together with "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/, so you can test on multiple databases and in multiple Rubies. And yes, it'll even clone Rails in a shared directory, so you can develop on your Mac like you're used to. Also, be sure to read "Jeroen's article on the Cookiestack blog":http://blog.cookiestack.com/post/571168451/testing-rails-for-the-masses.

I've learned a lot during the Bugmash and I highly recommend every Rails developer to give it a shot next time. Thanks "RailsBridge":http://railsbridge.org/, "@josevalim":http://twitter.com/josevalim, "@spastorino":http://twitter.com/spastorino, "@rizwanreza":http://twitter.com/rizwanreza, "jeroenvandijk":http://github.com/jeroenvandijk and everyone else who participated and helped out. You're awesome.

h3. Now what?

Like "the Railsbridge post":http://railsbridge.org/news_items/14 stated: this Bugmash was the &ldquo;most effective yet&rdquo;. That's great, but we're not done yet. If you've participated in the Bugmash, you know that the "Bugmash tag in the Rails issue tracker":https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/bins/41908 still has over 100 unresolved tickets.

I suggest we keep going and spend some of our time to "keep giving back":http://www.enlightsolutions.com/articles/pledge-3-percent-for-rails-3/, like fixing a small bug, writing some tests or reviewing a patch. Who's with me?
