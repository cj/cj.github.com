After an eight hour flight and a three hour train ride, "@roy(Roy Tomeij)":http://twitter.com/roy, "@thijsc(Thijs Cadier)":http://twitter.com/thijsc, "@roncadier(Ron Cadier)":http://twitter.com/roncadier, "@matsimitsu(Robert Beekman)":http://twitter.com/matsimitsu, "@antekpiechnik(Antek Piechnik)":http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik and I arrived in Baltimore for "Railsconf":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010. In this article I'll talk about some of my personal highlights.

Since we didn't go to any "tutorial sessions":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/stype/3+hour+tutorial, our Railsconf started on Tuesday, which gave us the time to eat burgers, drink beers and go to Washington before the conference.

In ["@jnunemaker(John Nunemaker)":http://twitter.com/jnunemaker]'s &ldquo;["Don’t repeat yourself, repeat others":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14323]&rdquo;, John gave a great peek into some stuff he learned while building "MongoMapper":http://mongomapper.com/. He urged everyone in the room to steal and write about it and explained why most of his open source projects are stolen as well. MongoMapper's internals -- like the plugin system -- look really nice, I have to look into that soon.

For his book -- "Agile Webdevelopment with Rails":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356166?ie=UTF8&tag=jeffkreef-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356166 -- "@samruby(Sam Ruby)":http://twitter.com/samruby needed a test suite to check if the code samples keep working in newer versions of Rails. In "his talk":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/12359 he showed a "bug report he submitted to the Rails Lighthouse":https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4781-rjs-function-tests-fail, created using his open source project called "Gorp":http://github.com/rubys/gorp (amongst others). His approach seems like a really nice way to submit a proper bug report and a little script to reproduce the problem without manually having to generate rails applications, generate scaffolds, edit files and test manually.

On Tuesday evening, "@wycats(Yehuda Katz)":http://twitter.com/wycats gave a "fantastic keynote":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14132 that really inspired me to get my hands dirty. That meant I dove into "Navvy":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/navvy after drinking some beers at the "Blue Box Group":http://www.blueboxgrp.com/ party later that night. And no, I didn't get anything done.

I missed the Ruby Hero awards that night, but I'd like to congratulate "@fxn(Xavier Noria)":http://twitter.com/fxn, "@josevalim(José Valim)":http://twitter.com/josevalim, "@qrush(Nick Quaranto)":http://twitter.com/qrush, "@tenderlove(Aaron Patterson)":http://twitter.com/tenderlove, "@wayneeseguin(Wayne E. Seguin)":http://twitter.com/wayneeseguin and "@seacreature(Gregory Brown)":http://twitter.com/seacreature. Great job and thanks for all your work guys!

I was really looking forward to ["@defukt(Chris Wanstrath)":http://twitter.com/defunkt]'s "talk":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14595 about "Redis":http://code.google.com/p/redis/ and "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque in "Github":https://github.com/. Chris gave some great insights into their background job processing strategy, which gave me some new ideas to steal ("Nunemaker said I could":#steal) for Navvy. It didn't bother me during the talk, but I would've loved some slides for later reference since he gave a lot of information I can't really remember right now.

"@josephwilk(Joseph Wilk)":http://twitter.com/josephwilk had a talk called "Rocket Fueled Cucumbers":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14404 in which he explained some optimizations "Songkick":http://songkick.com did to their slow "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ test suites. Although "I switched to Steak":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/steak-because-cucumber-is-for-vegetarians a while back, I learned a lot from this talk and it got me thinking about some stuff we could still do with Steak in the future. Expect more on this soon.

On Wednesday evening, "@deadprogram(Ron Evans)":http://twitter.com/deadprogram organized the "Music Jam":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14604, which treated us to some musical awesomeness I wasn't really expecting from a bunch of programmers. Great show, I didn't know you guys are rockstars as well.

The last day, "@imf(Ian McFarland)":http://twitter.com/imf gave a talk called "Agile the Pivotal Way":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14554 bout the way they work at "Pivotal Labs":http://pivotallabs.com. Ian covered things like pair programming, having breakfast and playing ping pong at work and it was a great eye opener for all of us. We even made an appointment to come over to their New York office to have a look around. Expect a post about this on the "80beans":http://80beans.com blog soon.

I've had a great time this year and I hope to be able to come next year again. We're in New York for the last part of the 80beans US trip right now ("awesome pictures by Antek":http://www.flickr.com/photos/piechnik/sets/72157624235560242/), but we'll be back home on Wednesday.

If you've sent me a question or pull request: sorry for the wait, I'll get back to you after I come back.

Oh, and if you're ever in Baltimore, be sure to visit "the Abbey Burger Bistro":http://www.abbeyburgerbistro.com/ for awesome burgers, beer and free wifi. Just sayin'.
