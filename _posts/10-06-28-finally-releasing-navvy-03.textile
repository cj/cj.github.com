excerpt: Announcing a new version of Navvy, the database agnostic Ruby background job processor.

It's been a while since the last proper release of "Navvy":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/navvy -- the database agnostic Ruby background job processor -- but like I "promised a while back":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/rise-of-the-navvy/, I've been working on a new version whenever I could find the time.

!http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/images/steam_navvy.jpg(Navvy 0.3)!

I'm really excited to release "Navvy 0.3":http://rubygems.org/gems/navvy/versions/0.3.0 and I think you're going to love it. It's "great, fantastic, amazing and magical":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7v815bYUw and I'd like to highlight four &ldquo;tent poles&rdquo; for you today.

Ok, no more Apple marketing techniques. Promise.

h3. Mongoid

In addition to the adapters for "ActiveRecord":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html, "DataMapper":http://datamapper.org/, "Sequel":http://sequel.rubyforge.org/ and "MongoMapper":http://mongomapper.com, Navvy 0.3 intoduces a "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/ adapter that works exactly like the rest. Special thanks to "@TomK32":http://twitter.com/TomK32 and "@rubenfonseca":http://twitter.com/rubenfonseca for helping out.

h3. Navvy::Logger

The previous logger -- called @Navvy::Log@ -- was rather nasty due to some bad design decisions I made a while back, so I decided to completely rewrite it. Now it extends the "Logger":http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Logger.html from the standard Ruby library, which makes it more reliable and a lot smaller.

Navvy will log to @STDOUT@ by default, but using @Navvy.configure@ you can provide your own logger:

{% highlight ruby%}
Navvy.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Logger.new('~/navvy.log')
end
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Daemons

As I said in "my previous Navvy article":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/daemonizing-navvy-with-god, I want to encourage users to use a process monitor (like "God":http://god.rubyforge.org/) since I believe handling background processes is none of Navvyâ€™s business. 

That's why Navvy's generator doesn't create the @script/navvy@ file anymore. Also, the nasty @Navvy::Worker.daemonize@ is gone. If you want to daemonize your worker process, you should set it up yourself now.

h3. Generators

Navvy has had a Rails generator to create migrations for a while now, but it was ActiveRecord only. In 0.3, the Rails 2 and Rails 3 generators can create migrations for Sequel as well. 

As you probably know, DataMapper, MongoMapper and Mongoid don't need migrations. That means all generators are really easy to set up now. 

h3. Cleanups

Last but not least, Navvy got cleaned up quite a bit since 0.2. For example: the gem isn't built with "Jeweler":http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler anymore, which resulted in a cleaner @Rakefile@, a cleaner @.gemspec@  and no more need for that nasty @VERSION@ file. 

For contributors (["&hearts;":http://wiki.github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/navvy/contributors]), Navvy uses "Bundler":http://gembundler.com now, so you can quickly install everything you need to start hacking on Navvy. 

That's it. Be sure to give Navvy a try some time. The "wiki":http://wiki.github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/navvy/ is quite comprehensive but if you run into any problems, be sure to "ask":http://github.com/inbox/new/jeffkreeftmeijer, or "create an issue on Github":http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/navvy/issues.
