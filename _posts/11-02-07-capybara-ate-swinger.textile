About three months ago, I "released Swinger":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/capybara-driver-swapping-on-rspec-with-swinger to add "RSpec":http://github.com/rspec driver swapping to "Capybara":http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara.

This idea wasn't new, Capybara had doing it "for Cucumber":https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/cucumber.rb for quite some time. Cucumber has this nice tagging thing that allows you to hook in and do cool stuff like that.

RSpec didn't have a feature like that until 2.0, when it released the "metadata feature":http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2010/06/14/filtering-examples-in-rspec-2. That made it possible to pass arbitrary metadata to examples or example groups, allowing you to tag examples. Like in Cucumber. But better.

Using that, I built Swinger for a big project we were working on at "80beans":http://80beans.com. It was still a bit of a monkey patch, since RSpec didn't really provide a way to access an example's metadata in the around hook, but it worked pretty well.

Not long after relasing it as a separate gem, I turned Swinger into a "Capybara pull request":https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/pull/187. It was still a monkey patch, so "@dchelimsky(David Chelimsky)":http://twitter.com/dchelimsky did "a patch for RSpec":https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/issue/221 to expose the metadata in around hooks, which made it possible for "@jncoward(Jonas Nicklas)":http://twitter.com/jncoward to eventually built a cleaner version of the driver swapping idea into Capybara.

h3. Driver Swapping in Capybara, without the crap

Now, since Capybara version -"0.4.1":http://rubygems.org/gems/capybara/versions/0.4.1- "0.4.1.1":http://rubygems.org/gems/capybara/versions/0.4.1.1, it supports driver swapping out of the box. Here's how to get it working.

First, in the file where you set up Capybara (that's @spec/acceptance/acceptance_helper.rb@ if you're using "Steak":https://github.com/cavalle/steak). Include Capybara's RSpec helper file:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'capybara/rspec'
{% endhighlight %}

Now, just like with Swinger, you can tag your examples with a specific @:driver@:

{% highlight ruby %}
it "does fancy stuff", :driver => :selenium do
  # test fancy stuff
end
{% endhighlight %}

Of course you can also use this on example groups:

{% highlight ruby %}
context "fancy stuff", :driver => :rack_test do
  # fancy examples
end
{% endhighlight %}

If you set @Capybara.javascript_driver@, you can even tag examples that need a javascript capable driver like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium

it "does fancy stuff", :js => true do
  # test fancy stuff
end
{% endhighlight %}

This officially means I stopped maintaining Swinger and I urge you to update Capybara to 0.4.1.1. Thanks to everyone who helped out building Swinger and getting it into Capybara, it certainly made my test suites a lot faster.
